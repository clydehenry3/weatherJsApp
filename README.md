# Weather JS Project 

Hello! I am a UX Designer looking to get into Front-End Development. This is my first JS project after learning from fCC.
I will be updating this file as I work on this project. **I am not seeking for this to be an open-source project/collaboration, but any feedback is greatly appreciated.
